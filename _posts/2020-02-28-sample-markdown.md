# Ideas to work on


When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$

<summary>Graph Algebras</summary>
Both Magnitude Path Spectral Sequences (MPSS) and Leavitt Path Algebras discuss aspects of a graph's reach or spread, though from different perspectives. Interestingly, both use the Euler characteristic in their study of the graph properties. This invariant can be used to determine the expander properties of the graph, and then to compare the results using the Ihara Zeta function and the prime cycle decomposition.
